Create a program that uses the user's height and weight to determine the Body Mass Index (BMI).

It ought to inform them of how their BMI is interpreted in light of their BMI.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
